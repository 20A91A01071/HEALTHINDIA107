<p>A new study found a possible link between aluminum used in early childhood vaccines and the risk of children developing asthma before age 5.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the authors of the study caution that the results are not strong enough to suggest “questioning the safety of aluminum in vaccines.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instead, they call for additional research to better understand this risk. This might include studies using other large vaccine safety databases, and laboratory studies looking at children’s immune responses after vaccination.</p>

<p><a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/monica.gandhi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Monica Gandhi</a>, a professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco, who was not involved in the new research, said it is important to reassure parents about the safety of vaccines.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There is absolutely no indication at this point [that we should] change our vaccine formulations or recommendations on routine&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">childhood vaccinationsTrusted Source</a>,” she said.</p>

<h2><a><strong>Previous research mixed</strong></a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aluminum is used in many vaccines as an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/adjuvants.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adjuvantTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;— which helps create a stronger immune response in people who receive a vaccine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Childhood vaccines that contain an aluminum adjuvant include: diptheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP); hepatitis B; Haemophilus influenzae type b (HiB) vaccine; and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The COVID-19 vaccines and seasonal flu vaccines do not use an aluminum adjuvant.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Previous research on the link between childhood vaccines and asthma has been mixed, the authors of the new study pointed out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One study found a small increased risk of asthma in children who received certain vaccines, while other studies found no increased risk or even a smaller risk of asthma.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>None of these studies, though, looked specifically at exposure to aluminum in the vaccines, which the current study did.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, rates of asthma among American children&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5608a1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increased in the 1980s and 1990sTrusted Source</a>, but have largely&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6705e1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remained the sameTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;between 2001 and 2016, according to CDC data. So multiple factors are likely driving these trends.</p>

<h2><a><strong>Examining a potential vaccine-asthma link</strong></a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The new study is based on electronic health records of nearly 327,000 children born between 2008 and 2014 who received care at seven sites that participate in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vsd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vaccine Safety DatalinkTrusted Source</a>, a collaboration with the CDC to study vaccine safety.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The researchers divided the children into two groups — those with a diagnosis of eczema by 12 months of age and those without.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like asthma, eczema is a form of allergic disease. Children with eczema also have a&nbsp;<a href="https://ctajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13601-020-0310-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">higher risk of developing persistent asthmaTrusted Source</a>. So if there is a link between aluminum in vaccines and the risk of developing asthma, it might show up differently in the two groups.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Researchers estimated each child’s exposure to aluminum by looking at how many vaccines they received before the age of 2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They then looked to see which children developed persistent asthma between the ages of 2 and 5. Researchers defined persistent asthma as children having at least one inpatient healthcare visit or two outpatient or emergency department visits for asthma, and receiving at least two prescriptions for long-term asthma medication.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In both children with and without eczema, researchers found a positive association between exposure to aluminum in vaccines and the risk of developing asthma. The risk was higher for children with eczema.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This association remained when researchers accounted for other factors such as sex, race, ethnicity, food allergies, and number of healthcare visits. However, in some of the other analyses that the researchers did, the association was no longer present.</p>
